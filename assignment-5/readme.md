I chose to design my page around the 1980s. I picked out some pictures that reflect some of the things I thought were coolest about the decade. I used some of the colors that I think reflected the decade and the design in the pictures I had chosen.

 I picked light light blue, aguamarine, salmon, deepskyblue, spring green and aqua for my colors.

I enjoyed the work for this assignment because it was really creative. I think it was a fun assignment and the only difficulties I really had were choosing the colors and fininding their css names.
